# spam-classifier-webserver
A Flask based webserver which accepts text from user through webservice,
and generates prediction whether the text is spam or ham.

The data is a collection of SMS messages tagged as spam or ham that can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset). 
First, we will use this dataset to build a prediction model that will accurately classify which texts are spam.

Naive Bayes classifiers are a popular statistical technique of e-mail filtering. 
They typically use bag of words features to identify spam e-mail. 
Therefore, Weâ€™ll build a simple message classifier using Naive Bayes theorem.
